 ~~~~~~ Additions
  Project added to git https://github.com/tarreislam/teenyscript (This thread will always have the latest version ofc)
  Created a homepage for documentation and examplecode: http://teenyscript.tarre.nu/documentation
  More error checking done by TS when parsing
  Com error detection is now as advanced it can be, it will always show the .ts file and exact line where the com error is occured at.
  Added new keyword "construct" see more at http://teenyscript.tarre.nu/documentation#13-Func(Construct)
  Class and extension methods can now be assigned with @Private and @Public (If none is presented, @Public will be used) (Didnt know that feature existed in AO untill recently)
  Added new  class method feature "Construct", see more at the documentation
  Properties can now have lists and arrays assigned directylty to them (@Private $this.list = {"key" => "value", "key": 1234}, @Private $this.array = [1,2,3,4,5, [1,2,3,4,5]])
  Scite Calltips & Keywords for TeenyScript can now be installed through the options gui
  Added a more pleasent Options GUI (All features and settings will be handled here)
  Everything written from TeenyScript will be logged under logs/* and will only be accesable when TeenyScript is not running, this is for unexpected crashes etc.
  A sort of "Project" system is now created, which allows you to easily compile your script with various settings (See F8 -> create new project)


~~~~~~ Changes
	Removed #MAIN and replaced it with #DEBUG that will only work when RUNNING the script (F5)
	Namespaces can no longer be used in #DEBUG (old #MAIN)
	@Namespaces must be the declared at the TOP of the file  (BEFORE INCLUDES) (MUST)
	__parent__ is now PRIVATE instead of READONLY
	AutoitObject is now added directly as code to the script, rather than being included with AutoIts regular #include (Removing the step of forcing the user to add the library as an UDF in Scite Options)
	AutoitObject is only included when actual AutoitCode is used.

	#Include "/*.ts" previously checked the "execution dir", but now it just goes to the parent folder. #Include "//*.ts" will instead run from the execution folder

~~~~~~ Buggfixes & misc

	Removed a random _Array Udf that i forgot was there



~~~~~~ Things that i have on the rader, but didnt feel neccesary to implement due to the already delayed RELEASE of TeenyScript
 Interfaces
 Recursive usage of lists ( {"next_list": {"third_list": {"a": 1}}})
